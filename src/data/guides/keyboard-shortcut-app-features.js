      heading: '1. Active App Detection',
      content: [
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'The most important feature in a shortcut app is automatic active app detection. When you switch from Chrome to Figma, the shortcut display should update instantly without any action from you. This eliminates the need to manually select which app\'s shortcuts to view.' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Some tools require you to hold a modifier key to show shortcuts (and they disappear when you release). Others require you to manually navigate to the right app in the tool. The best tools detect the switch automatically and keep the shortcuts visible as long as you need them.' },
        { type: 'callout', text: 'Active app detection typically requires Accessibility permissions on macOS. This is a standard OS-level API — it reads only the frontmost app\'s identifier, not any window content.' },

      content: [
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'You don\'t always know which app has the shortcut you need. A good shortcut app lets you search across all supported applications at once. Type "paste without formatting" and see the shortcut for that action in every app that supports it.' },
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'Search should be fast (instant results as you type), fuzzy (tolerant of typos), and grouped by app (so you can see context). A flat list of ungrouped results is much harder to scan.' },

      content: [
        { type: 'paragraph', text: 'How shortcuts are displayed matters as much as what shortcuts are included. A well-designed shortcut app renders key combinations with styled keycap badges that mimic real keyboard keys — making them instantly recognizable and easy to read.' },

        },
